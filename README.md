## 🎯 Project Overview

**Prosperity** is a personal portfolio tracker and overview tool designed to modernize and simplify stock investment tracking for personal use. Built as a learning project, it demonstrates a hybrid cloud architecture (AWS + Azure) using modern web technologies including Blazor WebAssembly and Go serverless functions.

**Application Type:**
- **Personal Use:** Not intended for professional or regulated financial management
- **Portfolio Tracker:** Overview and tracking tool, not a full portfolio manager
- **Simplified Auditing:** Audit trail only for deposits and transfers (for total invested calculations)
- **Flexible Data Entry:** Minimal required fields (quantity + invested amount) with optional details

### Key Features
- 📊 **Real-time Portfolio Dashboard** - Instant view of total value, P/L, and performance across all accounts
- 💼 **Multi-Account Management** - Organize investments across TFSA, US, ZA, EUR, and Property accounts
- 📈 **Live Price Updates** - Automatic stock price fetching via Google Finance API
- 💱 **Multi-Currency Support** - USD, EUR, GBP with automatic conversion to ZAR
- ⚡ **Quick Entry** - Only quantity and invested amount required for adding investments
- 💰 **Cash Flow Tracking** - Immutable deposits and transfers for audit trail
- 💵 **Manual Balance Adjustments** - Track dividends, interest, and profits via direct balance edits
- 🔄 **Insert or Update Logic** - Automatically updates existing investments or creates new ones
- 📥 **Import/Export** - Bulk CSV import/export for data portability
- 🌓 **Light/Dark Themes** - Customizable appearance
- ⚙️ **Configurable Settings** - Customize exchanges, industries, types, and actions

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Prosperity uses a **hybrid cloud architecture** combining AWS for static hosting and Azure for serverless backend:
